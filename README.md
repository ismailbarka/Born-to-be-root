The 42cursus project "Born2beroot" is a comprehensive guide on setting up and securing a virtual machine using VirtualBox or UTM. It covers various topics including the installation of essential tools like sudo, SSH, and UFW, user management, password policies, and the implementation of security measures such as AppArmor. The guide also explores the concepts of Virtual Machines, LVM (Logical Volume Manager), and the differences between Apt and Aptitude package managers.

Configuring WordPress on the server.
Bonus - FTP Configuration:

Installing and configuring vsftpd for FTP access.
Submission and Peer-Evaluation:

Providing a signature.txt file containing the SHA1 hash of the virtual machine's disk.
The guide emphasizes practical hands-on experience and encourages repetition for better understanding, making it suitable for learners getting acquainted with Linux and virtualization.
